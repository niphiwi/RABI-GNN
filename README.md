# RABI-GNN

## Introduction
This repository contains the code of *Radius-Based, Bi-Directional Graph Neural Networks (RABI-GNN)* for Gas Distribution Mapping. Gas Distribution Mapping describes the process of mapping the spatial and temporal distributions of gases in a given area. This repository is work in progress.

## Gas Distribution Dataset
The synthetic gas distribution dataset is available in the repository of [Super-Resolution for Gas Distribution Mapping](https://github.com/BAMresearch/SRGDM/).
